<p>Hello, I'm Robbe Van de Vyver, a 25-year-old Senior SOAR Engineer at NVISO. With a strong foundation in programming and networking from my studies in Applied Computer Science at Hogent, I have developed a robust skill set in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>My journey began with an internship at NVISO, which led to my first role as a Junior SOAR Engineer in the MDR service line. After a year in this position, I transitioned to SOAR Engineering within the Professional Services sector. Here, I assist customers in building playbooks and integrations, as well as setting up their complete SOAR infrastructure.</p>
<p>This experience has not only honed my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to communicate effectively. I am able to bridge gaps between teams, all working towards the common goal of making your SOC more efficient and performant.</p>
